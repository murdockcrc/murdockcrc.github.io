In the last couple of weeks, there's been a couple of high-profile cases where companies have denounced the behavior of Apple and its operation of the App Store.

Let's image a hypothetical scenario:

# It's 1998

_Microsoft announces a change in their operating system, Windows: starting with the next version, all applications (back then,  the term 'app' did not exist) need to be installed using the Microsoft Store. Distributing Windows software by copying/sharing .exe and compressed files is not allowed anymore, and the operating system will prohibit such installations of software. Furthermore, developers who monetize their software will need to pay a Microsoft a 30% fee._

If  Microsoft would have indeed made such a decision, the outrage would have been of epic proportions. The DOJ would have probably won its anti-trust case of 1999. Having Microsoft do something like that would have been outrageous, yet a smaller company managed to do just that in 2008.

# What is the value of the App store?
When Apple introduced the App Store in 2008, the concept actually made sense.

## Protects against malware
Everyone knew that Windows' way of distributing software (by floppy disks/CDs and copying installation files offline) was the perfect ground to distribute malware. The App Store promised to be a security gateway, where Apple controlled that every application was developed in a secure way.

## Protects the user experience
By forcing developers to adhere to basic usability principles, the App Store also made sure that applications didn't suck too much.
