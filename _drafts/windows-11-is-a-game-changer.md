# Intro

I've been using the dev insider Windows 11 preview build for about 2 weeks and have nothing but respect for the work Microsoft has done.

When screenshots of Win11 were leaked before the official announcement, there was a lot of hate talk against it (how people can judge an operating system by looking at leaked screenshots still amazes me, but OK, it's easy to shit-talk online). So I put the first available build into my laptop and after two weeks or using it for work everyday, here's a wrap up.

# UI

The user interface of Win11 is rad. It is a bold move from Microsoft, given the legacy Microsoft has to carry forward for Windows.

The UI is visually appealing.

It's peaceful.

The Windows 11 user interface is simply harmonious. Everything works together well to build an experience. The typography. The iconography. The transitions and animations. The layouts of information. The colors, acrylics and transparencies. Win11 is by far the best-looking OS so far. Win11 is a product you want to look at, cause it's so nice.

# Compatibility

I upgraded my Lenovo X1 Extreme from Win10 to Win11. The process took about 1-2 hours and did not throw any errors. No driver issues. No app compat issues. It all just simply worked perfectly.

I only use Microsoft software on my laptop (Office, VScode, Visual Studio, and such), I don't have Line-of-business apps or third party apps which might break. You should be careful as third-party apps or in-house enterprise apps might have compatibility issues.

# Performance

Performance is on par with Win10. I do not see an improvement or deterioration on perf. I don't know if the engineering team still needs to do performance optimization on the OS, but for now I can confirm perf is unaffected in any positive or negative ways.

# Battery Life

Batt life has been the same as on Win10. I was expecting to see better battery life, given optimizations in CPU/GPU and memory management. However, this might materialize later in future builds.

# Start Menu

This is one of the items that took the most hate after the screenshot leaks. The start menu at the center makes sense. It fits into the design language of the OS and I would not have it any other way.

The start menu itself it better looking than its Win10 counterpart, but it is still as useless as before. All those "pinned" apps on the top do not help on making me more productive:

You don't need any of this. If you are looking for an app, it's much faster to simply:

* Press the Windows key on the keyboard
* Start typing the name of the app you are looking for
* Select the app from the result

This feature is not new to Windows 11, but the search results on Win10 were notoriously poor. I find the search results in Win11 are now much more relevant.

The _Recommended_ section of the Start Menu does seem helpful to me, as Windows recognizes the last files/documents you have interacted with and displays them in that menu. This is convenient and increases productivity.

Another feature which works well is the general Windows search, which you can activate by pressing _Alt + Spacebar_ on your keyboard. This is also not a new feature of Win11, you can do this in Win10 too. It's a copy of Mac's Spotlight search, but it works really well and in my opinion, it could completely replace the need for a Start Menu at all:
