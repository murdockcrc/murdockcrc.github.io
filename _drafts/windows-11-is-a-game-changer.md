# Intro

I've been using the dev insider Windows 11 installation for about 2 weeks and have nothing but respect for the work Microsoft has done.

When the leaks screenshots of Win11 were leaked before the official announcement, there was a lot of hate talk against it (how people can judge an operating system by looking at leaked screenshots still amazes me, but OK, it's easy to shit-talk online). So I put the first available build into my laptop and after two weeks or using it for work everyday, here's a wrap up.

# UI

The user interface of Win11 is rad. It is a bold move from Microsoft, given the legacy Microsoft has to carry forward on Windows.

It's visually appealing.

It's peaceful.

The Windows 11 user interface is simply harmonious, everything works together well to build an experience. The typography. The iconography. The transitions and animations. The layouts of information. The colors, acrylics and transparencies. Win11 is by far the best-looking OS so far, and by a far stretch. Win11 is a product you want to look at, cause it's so nice.

# Compatibility

I upgraded by Lenovo X1 Extreme from Win10 to Win11. The process took about 1-2 hours and did not throw any errors. No driver issues. No app compat issues. It all just simply worked perfectly.

I only use Microsoft software on my laptop (Office, VScode, Visual Studio, and such), so I don't have Line-of-business apps or third party apps which might break. You should be careful as third-party apps or in-house enterprise apps might have compatibility issues.

# Performance

Performance is on par with Win10. I do not see an improvement or deterioration on perf. I don't know if the engineering team still needs to perform performance optimization on the OS, but for now I can confirm perf is unaffected on any positive or negative ways.

# Battery Life

Bat life has been the same as on Win10. I was expecting to see better battery life, given optimizations in CPU/GPU and memory management. However, this might materialize later in future builds.
