I"z<p>Through off-shoring, the relentless pursuit for profit has created an unacceptable amount of systemic risk in our societies.</p>

<p>The phenomenon knows as <em>Globalization</em> accelerated and picked up pace during the 1990’s. Large corporations were finally able to deploy their capital anywhere in the world. Accelerated by international commercial treaties, de-regulation, low oil prices and politica capital, multi-national companies started branching out of their home turfs and venturing outwards towards poorer latitudes.</p>

<p>Across boardrooms and senior executive teams, the idea of <em>cost reduction</em> took hold with fervor. Firms started off-shoring some of their most crucial activities, in particular manufacturing. With the realiability of industrial automation, you could produce the same goods, at (almost) the same quality anywhere in the world. So manufacturing labor started moving outwards to countries whose cost structure was much more attractive than at home (read: people where cheaper to hire).</p>

<p>Poor countries were armed with cheap labor. Tons and tons of it. Rich countries were armed with capital, intellectual property, and an insatiable customer base. Off-shoring meant huge cost saving for any industrial conglomerate. A massive shift took place, whereby companies invested capital in poorer countries to build manufacturing facilities, brought their production know-how to far-away places, hired cheap labor, and started production at a fraction of a cost compared to their home countries.</p>

<p>How do you produce goods in a place which is 10’000km away from customers? This massive shift in production required a fundamental re-architecting of the global supply chain. Raw materials needed to be procured and sent over to distant places. Transportation and logistics increased their complexity by orders of magnitude. Insurance had to play a more prominent role in protecting all those billions of dollars of materials and goods as they moved from one side of the world to the next one. Complex distribution chains had to be built for this purpose.</p>

<p>The formula proved to be successful. By putting the cost structure under pressure, profits increased. By producing cheaper, goods were accessible to even more customers, thus increasing sales.</p>

<p>Why produce textiles in Switzerland, when you could do it much cheaper in Honduras?
Why manufacture in Germany, if you could do it cheaper in Thailand?
Why pay the high salaries of “expensive” USA blue-collar workers, when Chinese workers could do the same job for much less?</p>

<p>The idea was executed wonderfully and was a win-win situation. Large multi-nationals could earn more money. The customers could have access to more and cheaper goods. Developing nations increased the employment of their workforce. Developed economies transfered some of their know-how and expertise to countries which did have it.</p>

<p>It all came crashing down with the Coronavirus.</p>

<p>The capacity of rich nations to produce tangible goods by themselves has been decreasing throughout the last decades. In some industries, rich countries cant even self-sufficiently produce some very essential goods. Rich, developed nations have become overly reliant on a global supply network which, when put under stress, can wreak social havoc in their home countries.</p>

<p>In their endless pursuit for profit, rich countries have annihilated their ability to produce basic goods themselves.</p>

<p>Manufacturing is not the only victim of this situatiion. Multinationals have also built <em>shared services</em> centers around the world to provide HR, Finance, Banking, call centers and customer support center in places with much cheaper labor. Software engineering is notorious for being off-shored in big quantities, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-06-28/boeing-s-737-max-software-outsourced-to-9-an-hour-engineers">sometimes with nefarious consequences</a></p>
