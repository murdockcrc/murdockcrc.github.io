I"©<p>I have been spending some time during the last weeks ramping up on NodeJS, just out of personal curiosity. In the process, Iâ€™ve built mock up web APIâ€™s, which I have hosted in the cloud. Going through this technical ramp up period, I have tried to lay my eyes on every piece of information about NodeJS, and eventually I found <a href="http://modernweb.com/2014/06/23/using-node-js-in-production/">this article</a>. The article is well written and technically accurate. It is not my intention to trash the article or its author, and I merely selected it for illustrative purposes because it embodies highly-specialized knowledge that is obsolete in a cloud-first world.</p>
